# hoopla-rails-metrics-quiz

## REQUIREMENTS

Your goal is to create a Ruby on Rails application that interacts with the Hoopla API in order todisplay a
list of Metrics and allow their values to be updated.  We only require a functioning app;
no bonus points are given for UX styling beyond basic readability.

This application should include:
* Landing page will display the list of configured metrics
* Clicking on a metric in the list will take you to a page where metric values are listed
  * __Values are listed for all the users in the organization (even if the user does not have a value set)__
    * In the metric listing page, for users without a value, display a 0 as the value
    * If there is no value, when you click on the user, you should be directed to a page where a new value can be created for that metric and user
  * Values are accompanied by the user's name
  * Only list user values, not team values
* Clicking a user row should take you to another page to edit the metric value. After the value is saved, the user list should be redisplayed, showing the updated value.
